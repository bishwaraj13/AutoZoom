# Environment setup

1. You need to have `poetry` installed. Cause this repo uses poetry as package manager.
2. Create poetry.lock file by running the command: `poetry install`
3. Start a poetry shell: `poetry shell`. This shall create a virtual environment in the repo itself `.venv`.

In future if you need any more libraries, just do `poetry add <package>`
Similarly, to remove any package `poetry remove <packahge>`
